# Plans for the Year

First of all, I don’t really know what’s going to happen this year or how it’s going to unfold, but I already have some goals that I will work hard to achieve.

## 1. Game Development with Lua and Love2D

One of my main projects this year will be developing a game using Lua and the Love2D framework. The game will be a fan project inspired by the popular Twitch streamer, Forsen. It will draw heavily from the gameplay style of the hit indie game *Vampire Survivors*. 

This will be a fun way to challenge myself creatively and technically, while also paying homage to a streamer I enjoy watching. My focus will be on creating engaging gameplay mechanics and an entertaining overall experience.

### Goals for this Project:
- Learn the basics of Lua and the Love2D framework.
- Develop functional gameplay inspired by *Vampire Survivors*.
- Incorporate unique elements that resonate with Forsen's fan community.
- Complete a playable prototype before the year ends.

## 2. Learning Linux

Yes, I know—I'm about to finish my Software Engineering degree, and yet I’ve never properly used Linux. That’s going to change this year. I plan to find a Linux distribution that suits me and learn it inside and out.

Linux is a critical skill for any developer, and I want to get comfortable with it, from installation and configuration to using it as my daily driver for programming and other tasks.

### Goals for this Journey:
- Explore and test a few Linux distributions to find the right one (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch Linux).
- Master basic Linux commands and terminal usage.
- Set up a dual-boot or dedicated Linux machine.
- Use Linux for software development and system-level programming tasks.
- Dive deeper into system administration and customization.

This year may be unpredictable, but these are the two major areas I’ll be focusing on. Here's to a year of growth and learning!
